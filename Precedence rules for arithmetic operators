# Operator/Convention

# ( )	
# Items within parentheses are evaluated first.	
# In 2 * (x + 1), the x + 1 is evaluated first, with the result then multiplied by 2.

# unary -	
# - used for negation (unary minus) is next.	
# In 2 * -x, the -x is computed first, with the result then multiplied by 2.

# * / %	
# 3 Next to be evaluated are *, /, and %, having equal precedence.

# + -	
# Finally come + and - with equal precedence.	
# In y = 3 + 2 * x, the 2 * x is evaluated first, with the result then added to 3, because * has higher precedence than +. 
# Spacing doesn't matter: y = 3+2 * x would still evaluate 2 * x first.

# left-to-right	
# If more than one operator of equal precedence could be evaluated, evaluation occurs left to right.	
# In y = x * 2 / 3, the x * 2 is first evaluated, with the result then divided by 3.
