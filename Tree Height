# Simple geometry can compute the height of an object from the object's shadow length and shadow angle using the formula: 
# tan(angleElevation) = treeHeight / shadowLength. Given the shadow length and angle of elevation, compute the tree height.

import math

angle_elev  = 3.8
shadow_len  = 17.5
tree_height = 0.0

tree_height = math.tan(angle_elev) * shadow_len

print('Tree height:', tree_height)
